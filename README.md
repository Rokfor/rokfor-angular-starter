> ### Getting up and running
> 
> 1. Clone this repo from `https://github.com/Rokfor/rokfor-angular-starter.git`
> 2. Run `npm install` from the root directory
> 3. Run `npm run dev` or `gulp dev`
> 4. Your browser will automatically be opened and directed to the browser-sync proxy address
> 5. To prepare assets for production, run the `npm run build` script (Note: the production task does not fire up the express > server, and won't provide you with browser-sync's live reloading. Simply use `npm run dev` during development. More > information below)
